# latex-templates

Collection of various LaTeX templates that I've been using over the time. More details about the template will be provided within the directory... soon.

## plymouth_msc
This is the template I've created and used to write my MSc dissertation at [Plymouth University](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk "Plymouth University"). It utilises the /scrbook/ class and complies with the regulations as of the academic year 2013/2014.

Please note, that I have replaced the original copyright notice with a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) License ([CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)), because I felt this to be the better way -- knowledge is to be shared. This has been agreed to by Plymouth authorities and should not be a problem.

## plymouth_report
This template has been used for writing various assignments over the course. The main differnce to the previous template is the usage of the /scrartcl/ class and a less complex directory structure.
